## Overview
ClamAV is an easy Lincisnckjds ux box featuring an outdated installation of the Clam AntiVirus suite. When the Sendmail mail filter is executed with the blackhole mode enabled it is possible to execute commands remotely due to an insecure popen call.

## Enumeration
The initial scan reveals a fair number of open ports
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ[192.168.49.200]-(calxus„âøcalxus)-[~/PG/ClamAV]
‚îî‚îÄ$ sudo nmap -p- -T4 192.168.200.42
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-02 10:48 BST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.200.42
Host is up (0.093s latency).
Not shown: 65528 closed ports

25/tcp    open  smtp

199/tcp   open  smux
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
60000/tcp open  unknown
```
There are a few distractions on this box, first there is a webserver that leaves a message in binary translating as "The quick brown ü¶ä jumps over 13 lazy üê∂.". Further fuzzing on the webserver did not reveal anything of interest. The samba server appears to be running an outdated version of samba, though this did not appear to match any vulnerable versions. Finally SSH appeared to also be running on an unusual port, though this did not appear to be vulnerable either. However the first breakthrough came when enumerating the SNMP port.

As shown we can see ClamAV running with blackhole enabled, this is interesting as we know the name of the box is ClamAV. Also when we query searchsploit for the sendmail server that is running on port 25 we see a reference to clamav-milter with blackhole mode.

```
## Foothold
We could use metasploit for this attack, but if we attempt first without it and choose the perl script. I had to remove the comments in the script and add the hashbang `#!/usr/bin/perl` then I could execute it with no other changes.

From the output it looks like it bound a listener to port `31337`, so when attempting to connect to it using netcat it resulted in a shell.

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation is not required as we got a root shell directly from the foothold
