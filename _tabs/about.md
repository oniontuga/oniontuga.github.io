## About the Author
I go by the handle *Hummus-Ful* which is one of my favorite dishes. It is a Vegan friendly stew of 
cooked fava beans on top of cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini.

I practice Information Security and Network related topic on a daily basis, yet I feel it is mostly theoretical. As a result I wanted to improve my "hands-on" experience. 

Intentionally vulnerable machines hosted by [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) 
and services such [Try-Hack-Me](https://tryhackme.com/) and [Hack-the-Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) provide just that - a controled environment you can hack freely (well... almost).




## About the Blog
* The Information Security community is very supportive and newcommers are always welcome. I remember my first years in the industry, where I I learned a lot from information shared by respectful community members. free of charge.
I would like this blog to provide exatly that - provide accessible, easy to understand, entry-level (and above) FREE knowledge. 
I try to make each post informative as possible, breaking commands some might see as arbitrary into small, understandable pices. 
In case additional reading is needed, links to external resources are provided.
The information found in this blog is mostly my notes from hacking my way on TryHackMe, HackTheBox and Vulnhub.

* That being said, I want to emphasize - **ALL INFORMATION IN THIS BLOG IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPESES ONLY. 
HACKING IS ILLIGAL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXPLICIT CONCENT FROM THE TARGET OWNER. STAY SAFE, STAY OUT OF JAIL! AND USE THE ABOVE PLATFORMS**

* Keep learning - You'll surlly need to use other information sources to keep learning. Please let me know if you want me to add any kind of materials to make it easy for others to learn.

* No tracking/analytics were added to this blog but I believe Github (hosting this blog) still enable some analytics. 

* Help spread the word - If you find the information in this blog intresting or if you learned anything please make your friends familiar with this blog and share it on social media

**Keep in mind:**
* I'm still a NOOB and I keep learning myself. These are my notes and some might have different ways of "doing things".
